# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. These guides centralize how we start, plan, execute, release, and improve projects so teammates can onboard quickly and work consistently.

Summary: OctoAcme Project Management Processes
- Customer-first and outcome-focused: Prioritize customer value and define measurable success.
- Iterative delivery: Deliver work in small, testable increments and validate with stakeholders.
- Clear roles & ownership: Each project has a Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead; developers, QA, and stakeholders have defined responsibilities.
- Artifact-driven lifecycle: Use a Project One-pager, backlog, release plan, risk register, and retrospectives to guide delivery.
- Consistent rhythms & communication: Regular standups, delivery syncs, demos, and stakeholder updates ensure alignment.
- Risk-aware execution: Maintain a risk register, escalate blockers per defined paths, and document mitigations.
- Continuous improvement: Run retrospectives, track action items, and measure impact.
